# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}

## Study

- [How to make Damage Popup Text (Unity Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD1_JczQcFY)

## Progress

- Separate player selection/action from player turn and resets
  - Selected target carries over between turns and can select not during your turn
  - Less button clicking = good
- Submenu for skill and button instantiation
- Actor destruction/creation to the battle setup function
  - Trivial "retry battle" button
- Begin implementing more game features/actual battles
- Simple credits text
- Simple text to indicate selected action
- Install textmesh pro for nicer text
- Damage popups

Almost finished with the actual game systems. From there it's all the "polish" things:
- Options configs
- Sounds
- "Bug-level" implementation
- More content

## TODO

- Options menu
  - Resolution
  - Windowed
  - Volume
- Battle
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Negative numbers (i.e. "reduce damage = heal boost")
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
  - Battle transitions
    - Move actors into/out of frame
    - Scene fade
- Assets
  - Songs: main menu, battle music, victory, defeat, ending
  - Sound effects + visual effects
    - On-hit, skill effects (i.e. heal noise)
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
    - Background disappearing/losing color
- Determine system requirements
  - Whatever unity build allows
  - "Mouse required" message
