# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Progress

- Add particle effects on hit
- Removed problematic resolution options because fixing bugs is overrated
  - Non 16:9 resolutions don't load with current method
  - I used a lot of absolute pixels instead of relative scaling so small resolutions are broken 
- Add byte swap action
  - Uses a spooky bug sound
- Load player objects from json
- Start adding out content to make use of abilities

## TODO

- Bugs
  - Hover text breaks after 2nd battle
    - Specifically on the genned buttons the battle after they're introduced -- the reference is lost?
  - Double fade animation on retry
  - Can't hover the turn order
- Assets
  - Songs
    - Fade music on switch (just use fade animation?)
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
    - Background disappearing/losing color
      - Trees/sky/whatever becomes pink/invisible
    - Static noise/visuals on hit
    - Things get darker (lighting, music)
- Finishing touches
  - More battles + actors
  - Main character asset (thinking a bug blob)
    - ~3f rolling movement
    - some jump-as-attack animation (12f necessary?)
    - 4f hurt anim, blob deform
  - Outro video
    - Worst case it's a blue screen -> fade to black
    - Best case it's the video of blob + blue screen
  - Cover art
- Determine system requirements
  - Whatever unity build allows
  - "Mouse required" message
