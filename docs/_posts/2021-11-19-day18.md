## Progress

- Bug affecting same-types actors because the deserialization of the BattleActor created a single actor object with multiple references
  - Unlike tags, actions, and effects, the actors need to be independent objects with separate private values
  - No native deepcopy means it's easier for me to serialize/deserialize to copy an object
    - Made the `_allActors` dict have a value of the base serializable actor object
    - Generate new post-serialization `IBattleActor` when required after "copying" the object from `_allActors`
- Prepping for mouse-selection of targets
  - Add a collider box and a `MouseSelectable` layer
  - Need to dynamically regenerate list of selectable objects whenever menu switches? For keyboard support

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Targeting system
    - Battle submenu (i.e. for skill usage)
    - Attach graphics to objects and playing animations
