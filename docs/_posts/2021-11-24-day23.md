## Study

- [STATIC NOISE TV EFFECT using Unity Shader Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO44o5pIr30)
- [Unity SHADERGRAPH Episode 9: Edge Noise (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9IRxv6tPoY)

## Progress

- Small adjustments to hit effects (popup color, sorting layer priority, subtract health on popup, etc.)
- Moved HUD updates in `BattleMenuScript` to LateUpdate (so that floating health properly renders before culling objects) 
- Fade + actor movement during battle transition
  - Sloppy messy crunch works against me. The animation should be related to the movement of the actor...
- Added a completely fake shadow because I'm too lazy to figure out how to get shadows off an invisible cylinder
  - Fake because it's a black circle on the ground attached to every actor. It's slightly misaligned because of the sprite/rotation/camera angle.
- Playing with shader graphs to get a glitchy effect
  - Grabbed a grass unity store asset
  - Ground can now flicker
- Began implementing a `BugManager` to control the glitch effects from bug level

It's interesting how some simple textures can make things look better.


## TODO

- Options menu
  - Resolution
  - Windowed
  - Volume
- Battle
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
- Assets
  - Songs: main menu, battle music, victory, defeat, ending
  - Sound effects + visual effects
    - On-hit, skill effects (i.e. heal noise)
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
    - Background disappearing/losing color
      - Trees/sky/whatever becomes pink/invisible
    - Static noise/visuals on hit
- Determine system requirements
  - Whatever unity build allows
  - "Mouse required" message
