## Study

- Animation events
  - Made a prefab object and used it to create an animation event to see how the clip-based animation event should be used

## Progress

- Add stats to hover and removed description during targeting
- Added animation events for hurt animation to play
- Fixed hover description for UI elements

## TODO

- Options menu
  - Resolution
  - Windowed
  - Volume
- Credits menu: all the asset creators
- Battle
  - Battle submenus (i.e. skill selection, item selection)
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Negative numbers (i.e. "reduce damage = heal boost")
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
  - Battle transitions
    - Move actors into/out of frame
    - Scene fade
  - Retry on defeat
- Assets
  - Songs: main menu, battle music, victory, defeat, ending
  - Sound effects + visual effects
    - On-hit, skill effects (i.e. heal noise)
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
- Determine system requirements
