# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Time and scope

We're 5 days away from the deadline, and realistically the last Sunday of November is my last day of real work.

So, 3 more days of progress to complete everything on the todo list? Seems...optimistic.

If we split the days it would looks something like:
- All the remaining system elements
- Content + asset generation
- Finishing touches

This doesn't seem like enough time given my rate of ~4 hr max per day. We'll see how much motivation I can gather to crunch.

## Progress

- Started downloading some free sound assets and identifying which to use for music/fx
- Began implementing the options menu and saving configs to json
- Realized a volume config is useless without sound and so implemented some basic music + on-hit sound effects
- Ran the first build! There's so little in here that it only takes a minute finish, neat

## TODO

- Options menu: Resolution, windowed, volume
  - Apply options (res/vol)
    - Fix ui elements based on resolution
  - Add sliders in options menu to change
  - Save off to file
- Battle
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
- Assets
  - Songs
    - Fade music on switch (just use fade animation?)
    - Properly choose track when necessary
  - Visual effects
    - On-hit
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
    - Background disappearing/losing color
      - Trees/sky/whatever becomes pink/invisible
    - Static noise/visuals on hit
    - Things get darker (lighting, music)
- Finishing touches
  - More battles + actors
  - Main character asset (thinking a bug blob)
    - ~3f rolling movement
    - some jump-as-attack animation (12f necessary?)
    - 4f hurt anim, blob deform
  - Outro video
    - Worst case it's a blue screen -> fade to black
    - Best case it's the video of blob + blue screen
  - Cover art
- Determine system requirements
  - Whatever unity build allows
  - "Mouse required" message

## Time Spent

53.25 + 3hr
