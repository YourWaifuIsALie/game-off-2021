# Game Off 2021 - Day 7
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Study

- Reading about modding in other games to understand how data management can be done
  - Read about [streamingAssetsPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StreamingAssets.html) and [persistentDataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html)
  - Looked at how [One Step From Eden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/960690/One_Step_From_Eden/) handled its mods
    - Didn't realize it was made in Unity, but it was obvious when I saw the `StreamingAssets/Data` and `StreamingAssets/Mods` paths. Guess I'm copying that
    - It uses Lua scripts for custom mod logic. An interesting thing to play with in the future
    - It's a great game anybody who reads this should go play it

## Progress

- Very little, it's a sleepy day. Made a `StreamingAssets` folder and verified `Application.streamingAssetsPath` agreed, but didn't put anything complete in it.

## TODO

- How to properly load assets from the `StreamingAssets` folder during runtime
  - Presumably I can just read the files into memory?
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Continue implementing data structures and basic examples
      - Full JSON templates
      - Boolean logic parsing
      - Fill out the rest of the example actor + additional actions/effects
    - Start work on the top-level BattleManager
