# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}


## Progress

I found time, look at that.

- Small bug fixes and more graphical assets
- Learning how sprite sheets work and creating a blobby bug
- Ending video
- Small adjustments and bugfixes

Last day is likely just bugfixes + the submission page.

I think this can be called technically complete if not feature complete.

## TODO

- Assets
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Some form of full-screen distortion if possible. Else, random floating squares
- Finishing touches
  - Cover art
- Bugs
  - Options + credits text not above the line
  - Fullscreen not working
  - Heal hover text not displaying

## Time Spent

65 + 6.25hr
