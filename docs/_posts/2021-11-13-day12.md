# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Study

- .NET 4 doesn't have a built-in PriorityQueue, apparently
  - .NET 6 does but that doesn't help me
  - OrderedLists and OrderedSets exist so that works for my purpose
- [String interpolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated) exists which is great since I'm used to Python f-strings
  - `Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! Today is {date.DayOfWeek}, it's {date:HH:mm} now.");` is the formatting usage. `$` instead of `f` but otherwise exactly the same

## Progress

- Loading of enemy list from json file for battle setup
- Beginning of battle control logic
  - Simple FSM
  - Creation of `GameObject` instances on the battlefield
  - Beginning of turn order control
    - Simple speed-based priority using a descending `SortedList`

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Player Input/AI input and completing actions
    - Changing of turns + new "turn bucket"
    - End battle conditions
    - Attach graphics to objects and playing animations
