## Study
- [Turn-Based Combat in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1pz_ohupPs)
- [Simple Turn-Based RPG Battle System (Unity Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QU0yV0CYT4)

## JSON definitions

Finished a basic implementation for loading "battle actors" from JSON files.
The most annoying part was realizing how `json.net` would deserialize into non-standard objects.

For my data structures, only the boolean logic related to when effects activate contains a arbitrarily nested dictionary.
So, I only need to manually parse that single field and turn it into a proper structure.

The logic is fairly simple:
- 4 keywords - "and, or, origin, target"
- Value is always a list of either dictionaries or strings
- If value is and/or, logic applies to all fields in dicts within the list until another and/or is reached

From there, it's just a matter of recursively parsing the dictionary structure and bubbling the true/false determination up to the top.
This allows me to create dumb rules that I probably won't even get to use for the game jam portion of this game.

Time well spent?

## Re-scope

As all projects go, being a beginner takes a lot of time, tangling with a lot of small C#/Unity things, let alone game logic + assets.

In this case, I got caught up on making this JSON deserialization/tag system. It's fine since I'm mostly doing this just to learn.
However, in terms of the "goal" of completing a project and a time-limited game jam, I definitely should have just dropped the system and hard-coded things.
These JSON specifications, deserializing, and boolean logic parsing are only useful if I'm making a real game full of assets.

In terms of game completion, there's no benefit implementing this now instead of getting some hard-coded thing working instead.
I spent something like 8 hours getting the kinks worked out of this which is vital time considering I have no gameplay yet.

Ultimately, I'll need to look at re-scoping and prioritizing at the end of this week. It's a conscious decision to be sloppier in order to get everything working.

## Progress

- Finished logic for fixing deserialization of JSON objects and evaluating boolean logic statements

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Implement the actual battle flow (order queue, state machine, etc.)
