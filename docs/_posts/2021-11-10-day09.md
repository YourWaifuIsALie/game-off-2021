# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Progress

- None, too tired. RIP the 1hr streak. It lasted longer than expected, really.

## TODO

- How to properly load assets from the `StreamingAssets` folder during runtime
  - Presumably I can just read the files into memory?
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Continue implementing data structures and basic examples
      - Full JSON templates
      - Boolean logic parsing
      - Fill out the rest of the example actor + additional actions/effects
    - Start work on the top-level BattleManager
