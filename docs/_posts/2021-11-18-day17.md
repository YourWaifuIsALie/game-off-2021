# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Progress

- Bug in my generic method: `return (T)_currentActor.GetComponent(typeof(T));` -> `return (T)obj.GetComponent(typeof(T));`
- Add health check for dead actors, culling dead actors to separate list, and check battle win/loss state
  - There might be a bug if two of the same type of actor are loaded in a battle

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Check/fix bug: identically typed actors affects simultaneously
    - Targeting system
    - Battle submenu (i.e. for skill usage)
    - Attach graphics to objects and playing animations
