# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Study

- Learning about [UnityEvents](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityEvents.html)
  - Very similar to a C# delegate (not that I know what that is either)
  - "...dynamic invocation of UnityEvents supports binding to functions with up to 4 arguments."

## Progress

- Started using custom string events to accept player input during battle
- Beginning of rudimentary GUI display to confirm system behavior
  - Turn order display. List of display names of actors, with bolded current turn.

The display names of the actors are in text on top in their turn order and an "attack" button is on the bottom.]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2021_11_14_battle_scene_wip.png "Battle scene WIP")

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Player Input/AI input and completing actions
    - End battle conditions
    - Attach graphics to objects and playing animations
