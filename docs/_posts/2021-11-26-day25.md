# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Progress

- Finished options, with a few lingering bugs
  - Sound volume configuration options
  - Resolution configuration
  - Menu sliders/dropdowns
  - Saving of the config json via a hack of the main menu being enabled

This is not finished system components because I'm feeling sick. Excellent timing.

## TODO

- Options menu bugs
  - Fix ui elements relative positions for screen resolution changes
  - Resolution can't switch to non-16:9
  - WindowMode doesn't update immediately
- Battle
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
- Assets
  - Songs
    - Fade music on switch (just use fade animation?)
    - Properly choose track when necessary
  - Visual effects
    - On-hit
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
    - Background disappearing/losing color
      - Trees/sky/whatever becomes pink/invisible
    - Static noise/visuals on hit
    - Things get darker (lighting, music)
- Finishing touches
  - More battles + actors
  - Main character asset (thinking a bug blob)
    - ~3f rolling movement
    - some jump-as-attack animation (12f necessary?)
    - 4f hurt anim, blob deform
  - Outro video
    - Worst case it's a blue screen -> fade to black
    - Best case it's the video of blob + blue screen
  - Cover art
- Determine system requirements
  - Whatever unity build allows
  - "Mouse required" message
