# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}


## Progress

- Hard-coded the window mode into the resolution function
- Adjusted relative position of some text elements
- Didn't fix the heal hover bug after the first battle in a real game window
  - It's probably just some overlapping UI element issue again
- Created the itch.io page and submitted to the game jam

## TODO

Good enough.
