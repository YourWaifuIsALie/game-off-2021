# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}


## Progress

- I forgot to add "targeting system" to yesterday's estimates. That's probably another couple of hours
- Added generic function for getting the script from a GameObject. It makes it a little less verbose?
- Added battle logic for getting an action, getting targets, and applying them

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Actor defeat (and bug overflow logic)
    - Targeting system
    - Battle submenu (i.e. for skill usage)
    - Simple floating health values
    - End battle conditions
    - Attach graphics to objects and playing animations
