# Game Off 2021 - {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}


## Study

- [How To... Billboarding in Unity 2020 - 2D Sprites in 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LRZcmX_xw0)

## Progress

- Added floating health and names to actor objects, rotated to main camera
- Clear user input upon turn cleanup (should also disable the menu buttons)
- Refactored some variables to UpperCase()
  - Kind of weird but Unity does it so I might as well

## TODO

- Figure out unit tests in for Unity/C#
- Figure out how to make Unity play nice with Git
  - Specifically non-text assets like textures, blender models, sound effects, etc.
- Keep playing with Jekyll, fixing things like links
- Continue nailing down specific battle mechanics and overworld power-ups
  - Bug-themed things
- Main character designs and 2d "sprite" (probably cutout animation) for both overworld and battle
  - Can visualize the rest of the world around the main character for consistency
- Start programming
  - Options
  - Overworld
  - Battle
    - Actor defeat (and bug overflow logic)
    - Targeting system
    - Battle submenu (i.e. for skill usage)
    - End battle conditions
    - Attach graphics to objects and playing animations
