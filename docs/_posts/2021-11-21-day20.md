## Study

- Terrain editor and how LOD group works (even if I don't use it properly) for terrain editor tree generation
- Children of colliders "merge", allowing multi-layer object colliders
- Learning about tags to easily identify collided objects
- Content size filter objects and horizontal layout group objects to get text-scaled boxes [Link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/HOWTO-UIFitContentSize.html)

## Progress

- Downloaded a bunch of free unitystore assets to use: low poly terrain, sprite characters
- Looked at the terrain editor and tree painter to make a more interesting background
- Added sprite + animation to actors (currently one sprite, attack + death animations)
- Began implementing hover text. This felt important to do because I am time constrained and it's the easiest way to both:
  - Explain how to play, quickly
  - Establish a narrative

There is a floating description box for a hovered-over actor.]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/2021_11_21_battle_scene_wip.png "Battle scene WIP")

## TODO

- Options menu
  - Resolution
  - Windowed
  - Volume
- Credits menu: all the asset creators
- Battle
  - Battle submenus (i.e. skill selection, item selection)
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Negative numbers (i.e. "reduce damage = heal boost")
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
  - Battle transitions
  - Finish UI hover descriptions
    - Context sensitive (i.e. don't show descriptions when targeting attacks)
  - Retry on defeat
- Assets
  - Songs: main menu, battle music, victory, defeat, ending
  - Sound effects + visual effects
    - On-hit, skill effects (i.e. heal noise)
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards
- Determine system requirements
  - Whatever unity build allows
  - "Mouse required" message
