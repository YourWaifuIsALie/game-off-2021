## Study

- [Unity RTS - Box Selection Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL1QgwaDsqo)

## Time and scope

A little more than one week left and I definitely don't put in enough time to complete this.

Crunch time?

If we're de-scoping further I think that means:
- Removing the overworld aspect, and instead have a canned series of fights with no choices beyond battle decisions
  - More like a puzzle, discovering "how" the game is buggy and steps needed to clear fights
  - Don't need more system programming, can re-use the same battle background
  - Walk-in/walk-out transition + quick victory celebration
- Using all the free assets I can get my hands on
  - Scenery, models with animations, and sound/music
  - My art + blender animation is still week and will probably take way too much time, that's a development for later
    - If I do have time, some simple "bug" main character would be great
  - Just implementing usage of graphics, animation, SFX, and sound will take a lot of time since I haven't done it.
- Keep the "bug-level" idea and, if possible, the cute ending video
  - It really helps bring together the bug theme and can provide a satisfying conclusion to this ~10 minute experience

## Progress

- Added basic mouse selection of game objects for targeting of player actions
  - Add ground to selectable layer, but ignore it upon selection (to avoid accidental passthrough selections)
- Logic to disable action button when action is currently selected

## TODO

- Options menu
  - Resolution
  - Windowed
  - Volume
- Credits menu: all the asset creators
- Battle
  - Battle submenus (i.e. skill selection, item selection)
  - Other "bug" effects. Let's go simpler
    - Negative numbers (i.e. "reduce damage = heal boost")
    - Attack the turn order (prevents OHKO)
    - Some on-the-nose abilities if this isn't enough
  - Graphics + animations
  - Battle transitions
  - Mouse over descriptions (skills, enemies)
    - This has to be where the narrative is told
  - Retry on defeat
- Assets
  - Find enemies + main character
  - Songs: main menu, battle music, victory, defeat, ending
  - Sound effects + visual effects
    - On-hit, skill effects (i.e. heal noise)
  - "Buggy" effects on all graphics/sound
    - Frame of disjointed squares
    - Sudden pitch/volume changes/play backwards

## Time Spent

34.75 + 2.5hr
